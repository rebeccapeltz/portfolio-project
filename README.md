# Portflio Step 1
This project is part of a course in which students can get experiences creating cropped and optimized images from the Cloudinary Service.  The first step of this training is to download this project and serve it locally.

In step 2 the student will collect images to use in the web pages that make up this project: 

- 1 image that show their work for home page (up to 8)
- 1 image for each project page (up to 8)
- 4 images that show their skills
- a picutre of themselves

## Run a local server

There are many ways to run a local http server.  An HTTP server is needed because the images will be served from the Cloudinary cloud.

You can run a server globally using an NPM package [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) is you have Node.js installed.  This will works on Mac, Windows or Linux.

```zsh
 npm i -g serve
 serve
 ```

If you use Visual Studio Code, yo can use an extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server).
